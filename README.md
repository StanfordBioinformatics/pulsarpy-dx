# Pulsarpy DX
A client for Pulsar LIMS that integrates sequencing results from DNAnexus


This is a companion tool to [pulsarpy](https://github.com/nathankw/pulsarpy), which in turn is offical
Python client for [Pulsar LIMS](https://github.com/nathankw/pulsar_lims). Pulsarpy DX is a gateway 
between Pulsar LIMS and any of your relevant sequencing results stored on DNAnexus, and serves to 
import the sequencing results metadata from the DNAnexus platform into Pulsar LIMS. If your sequencing results are
not stored in DNAnexus, then this package won't be of use to you. 

See documentation on [Read the Docs](https://pulsarpy_dx.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for more details.
